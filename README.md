# BIMM-143

This is my classwork from [BIMM 143 Spring 2019](https://bioboot.github.io/bimm143_S19/) at UCSD. 

Included are some R markdown files that represent a portfolio of the knowledge I acquired during my quarter in Dr. Barry Grant's upper-division Bioinformatics course at UCSD.

- Class 05: R basics, data structures, and data input
- Class 06: R graphics, generating plots with R
